## Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Philippines Flood Control Chatbot"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/flood-control-chatbot.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Streamlit Cloud Deployment
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click "New app"
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - Repository: `yourusername/flood-control-chatbot`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file: `streamlit_app.py`

### 3. Configure Secrets
In Streamlit Cloud app settings > Secrets:
```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key_here"
```

### 4. Test Deployment
- [ ] App builds successfully
- [ ] CSV upload works
- [ ] Data processing functions
- [ ] LLM responses generate correctly
- [ ] All UI elements display properly

## Post-Deployment

### âœ… Functionality Testing
- [ ] Upload the flood control dataset
- [ ] Test sample queries:
  - "What projects are in Palawan?"
  - "Show me the most expensive projects"
  - "Which contractors work on drainage systems?"
- [ ] Verify LLM responses are contextual and accurate
- [ ] Test advanced filtering features

### âœ… Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Check app loading times
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Verify API response times
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent users

### âœ… Documentation
- [ ] Update README with live app URL
- [ ] Share deployment guide with team
- [ ] Document any deployment-specific configurations

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Monitoring
- Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
- Check Streamlit Cloud app metrics
- Update dependencies as needed
- Monitor for any error logs

### Updates
- Test new features in local environment first
- Use git branches for major updates
- Deploy updates via git push to main branch
